# ArduWeight
Arduino + load cell + ethernet, using REST API 

- [x] Weight measure
- [x] Web server request
- [ ] Rest API

# Features

- Somewhat precise weight measurement
- Webserver uses HTTP 1.1 protocol
- Refreshes every 0.5 seconds

# Missing

- FULL calibration (at calibration time, I lacked a WELL known weight)
- REST API

# Good to know

It's possible that long time use can affect the measurement, further research
is required.

It's also possible to make a fancy function to re-Tare once in a while
